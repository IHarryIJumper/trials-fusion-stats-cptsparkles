## Local project launch

If you want to launch service on your local machine (honestly, i don't understand why), follow that instructions.

### Installing

First of all, you need to install [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io).

```
npm install webpack -g
```

Then install all project packages

```
npm install
```

Okay, project is ready to building.
